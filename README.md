# NiceDeck

This is a simple library for creating slideshows using the Python UI library [NiceGUI](https://nicegui.io/).
As an example, it contains the talk ["NiceGUI - Inventing Pythonâ€™s Nicest UI Framework"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5DnLgeObq4) given by [Falko Schindler](https://www.falkoschindler.de/) at PyCon Ireland 2023.

## Features

- Create slideshows in Python.
- Include Markdown, images, and code.
- Unveil parts of the slide step by step.
- Interact with NiceGUI code examples directly in the slides.
- View synchronized slide notes on another screen or mobile device.

## Getting started

```bash
pip install nicegui
python3 main.py
```

- Navigate with the arrow keys or using the navigation bar on the bottom.
- Open /notes in another tap or on another device to view the slide notes.
